    <p>And what if we got together a bunch of experts who work on large sites to create a definitive front-end performance guide?</p>

    <p>And not just one of those boring guides made for robots, what if we did something fun? What about getting together Briza Bueno **(Americanas.com)**, [Davidson Fellipe](https://github.com/davidsonfellipe) (Globo.com), [Giovanni Keppelen](https://github.com/keppelen) (ex-Peixe Urbano), Jaydson Gomes **(Terra)**, Marcel Duran **(Twitter)**, Mike Taylor **(Opera)**, Renato Mangini **(Google)** e SÃ©rgio Lopes **(Caelum)** to make the best reference possible? </p>

    <p>That's exactly what we've done! And we'll guide you in this battle to create even faster sites.</p>
